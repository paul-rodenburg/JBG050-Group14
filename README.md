## How to run the code

Run `main.py` to download the SQL database instantly (from Google Drive) or generate the database using the data available from [police.gov.uk](https://data.police.uk/data/). 
You will be asked if you want to download (**recommended option**) the database or generate it, after choosing it will automatically do everything for you without the need to download the data yourself
from your browser for example (this database does **not** include all the data needed for all the Python files. 
Additional datasets will be downloaded automatically
when the Python file, needing that dataset, is executed or can be downloaded manually: see 'Datasets' section below).

Tip: you can use this tool to inspect the SQL database: [Download sqlitebrowser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)

## Datasets
Most of the datasets will automatically be downloaded (if not already in the `crime_data.db`) in the Python files needing that dataset.
If running a Python file results in an error stating that the dataset could not be found then you can download it here: [Dataset Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RpGNBem3gWD_tUcbGM27W61PPtPMu_4U?usp=sharing).
