## How to run the code

Run `main.py` to download the SQL database instantly (from Google Drive) or generate the database using the data available from [police.gov.uk](https://data.police.uk/data/). You will be asked if you want to download the database or generate it, after choosing it will automatically do everything for you without the need to download the data yourself from your browser for example.

Tip: you can use this tool to inspect the SQL database: [Download sqlitebrowser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)
